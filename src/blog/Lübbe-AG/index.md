####A short description of my time at the Lübbe AG in the field of Finance and Controlling.

Before I started studying in the Netherlands, I decided to do a first internship in the field of Finance and Controlling in order to gain first practical knowledge in my field of interest. Even though I did not have any previous experience in this area, I was able to contribute with determination and hard-work. My initiative was rewarded with being able to attend several business meetings in order to see behind the curtain of the company.

I was responsible for establishing master files for interim statements and maintain already established master files. Furthermore, I supported the team in their monthly reporting as well as analysed key performance numbers.
