After six months of dedication and hard work, I was able to finish my bachelor thesis with the topic: "Apple Pay - risk or opportunity from the viewpoint of an acquirer".

During my studies, the [Arnhem Business School](http://www.arnhembusinessschool.com "Arnhem Business School") has always placed great value on the practical application of my theoretical knowledge. This is the reason why I have already written several Business Plans during the first year of my studies. Writing my bachelor thesis in cooperation with a company was the only next logical step in order to get the most in-depth practical experience possible.

To gather the necessary data for my bachelor thesis, I conducted desk research as well as field research. I was able to attend the [EHI Kartenkongress](https://www.kartenkongress.de/ "EHI Kartenkongress") in Bonn, which provided many useful insights into the development of mobile payment and its acceptance in Germany. I was able to conduct several expert interviews with people from renowned companies as for example Mastercard, Sparkasse or Paypal.

After finishing writing my bachelor thesis, I was still required to defend my thesis in front of my supervisor, examiner and second examiner from the Arnhem Business School. Having successfully passed the defence, I graduated from the Arnhem Business School in June 2018 with merit.
